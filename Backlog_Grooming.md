## Backlog grooming

objectives of backlog grooming sessions:
  Break down large user stories into smaller tasks.
  Discuss user stories with the team, answer any related questions to smooth out any ambiguity.
  Ensure upcoming user stories meet the team’s “definition of ready” by adding key contextual information and acceptance criteria.
  Sometimes (but not always) the scrum master or project manager and delivery team will use this session to estimate stories and assign story points.

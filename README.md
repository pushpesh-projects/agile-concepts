## Epics workflows

1. BACKLOG: A backlog is a prioritized list of tasks or features that need to be completed for a project. It is used to track progress, manage resources, and plan for future work.

2. VALUE DEFINITION: Value definition is the process of identifying the value that a project will deliver to stakeholders, such as customers, users, or shareholders. This helps ensure that the project is aligned with business objectives and that the work being done is meaningful.

3. EXPLORE SOLUTIONS: Exploring solutions is the process of identifying and evaluating different options for addressing a problem or meeting a requirement. This helps teams understand the trade-offs and potential risks associated with different approaches.

4. SPECIFY HOW: Specifying how refers to the process of defining the detailed requirements and specifications for a project. This includes defining the functionality, performance, and other constraints for the solution.

5. DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE: Development lifecycle refers to the overall process of designing, building, and deploying a product or solution. This includes phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

6. DONE: Done refers to the completion of a task or feature. This means that it has been fully implemented and tested, and is ready for release or deployment.

## Backlog grooming

**objectives of backlog grooming sessions:**
1. Break down large user stories into smaller tasks.
2. Discuss user stories with the team, answer any related questions to smooth out any ambiguity.
3. Ensure upcoming user stories meet the team’s “definition of ready” by adding key contextual information and acceptance criteria.
4. Sometimes (but not always) the scrum master or project manager and delivery team will use this session to estimate stories and assign story points.
5. Eliminating user stories that are no longer relevant or needed.
6. Developing and adding new user stories based on changing customer needs.
7. Reprioritizing user stories for the next sprint
